Report types
The Amazon Ads API supports a number of report types based on campaign entity structure. Depending on the ad type, campaign performance can be broken down by various dimensions including campaign, ad group, ad, keyword, target, and ASIN.

Availability by ad type
 Note
Sponsored Brands reports are currently available in preview. During the preview period, data related to Sponsored Brands campaigns with flag isMultiAdGroupsEnabled=False won’t be available. Once version 3 reporting supports all Sponsored Brands campaigns, we will announce general availability in the release notes.
Each type of sponsored ad supports different report types and has a separate path defined.
