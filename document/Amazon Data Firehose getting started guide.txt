Amazon Data Firehose getting started guide
Before you begin
To complete this tutorial, you will need:

Access to the Amazon Ads API
A valid Ads API access token
Your Ads API profile ID
An AWS account with appropriate access. Learn more about prerequisites for subscribing to the Firehose stream
An understanding of your company's cloud infrastructure and the final data output for Stream data
The ability to make basic cURL requests using a tool like Terminal or Postman
An understanding of the Amazon Marketing Stream datasets
Get started with Amazon Data Firehose
Note that you must be logged into AWS in the correct region before you can get started. Use the table to select the correct region based on the location of the advertiser you are creating a subscription for:

Advertiser region	AWS region
NA	us-east-1
EU	eu-west-1
FE	us-west-2
For full details on the countries that have access to Amazon Marketing Stream, see geographic availability.

Manual set up instructions
The manual set up instructions walk through creating a Firehose stream and IAM roles manually in the AWS console. If you'd prefer to review the steps manually or using a data output other than S3, see Manual steps. Otherwise, we recommend using the CloudFormation template for faster setup.

CloudFormation template set up instructions
 Note
This CloudFormation template only supports S3 as a data output. If you want to configure another data output (see Overview for all supported destinations), you will need to follow the manual process.
Important! Use of the CloudFormation template will automatically provision the following AWS resources:

An S3 bucket
An Amazon Data Firehose stream
Three (3) IAM roles
Steps
The following steps assume that you are logged in to your AWS account in the appropriate region as described above.

Go to GitHub and download a copy of Stream-Firehose-S3-CF-Template.yaml.
From the AWS console, search for “CloudFormation”.
From the CloudFormation page, go to Create Stack > With new resources (standard).
Under Prerequisite - prepare template, make sure Choose an existing template is selected.
Under Specify template, select Upload a template file, then choose the CloudFormation template you downloaded in step 1. Click Next.
Enter a name for your stack.
Under S3Storage, enter a name for the S3 bucket to be created.
Choose a Stream dataset ID that you want to be associated with this Firehose.
Enter a name for the StreamDestinationFirehose.
Under StreamRealm, choose a region associated to the subscription. Make sure this is the same as the AWS region you are signed in to.
After you’ve completed all fields, click Next. An example of the fields to select if subscribing to the sp-traffic dataset in North America is shown below:
Firehose CloudFormation config

Review the Configure stack options page, then click Next.
On the Review and create page, review your inputs. At the bottom, check the box that says “I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names,” then click Submit.
You are taken to a status page where you can review the progress of your stack.
Once your stack is complete, you can move on to the next step: Subscribing to Stream datasets.
